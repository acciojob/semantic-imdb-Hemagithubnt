        <p>
            The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful drama about hope, friendship, and perseverance. 
            The story follows Andy Dufresne, a banker who is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife 
            and her lover. Sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy befriends Red, 
            a fellow inmate, and finds ways to survive and maintain hope despite the brutal prison 
            environment. Over nearly two decades, Andy quietly works on an extraordinary plan while 
            helping the prison staff and inspiring fellow inmates with his unwavering spirit and determination.
